For this project I wanted to learn more about modern portfolio theory and how it should be implemented, therefore my analysis was centred on my financial discipline. The report is divided into two sections: 1) an application of the portfolio theory to the following five US stocks: Exxon Mobile, Nike, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and Visa; and 2) an assessment of whether the asset allocation suggested by the two businesses below is compatible with the theory.

For the sample period from January 2020 to December 2022, the data supplied was the monthly returns on each of the five equities, which I used in my analysis.
